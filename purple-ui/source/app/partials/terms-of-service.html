                                <p>THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT (hereinafter "You" or "Your") AND BEYOND BYTES TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD (hereinafter "Beyond Bytes") GOVERNING YOUR USE OF OUR PRODUCT - STATUSNAP.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h4>Parts of this Agreement</h4>
                        <p>This Agreement consists of the following terms and conditions (hereinafter the "General Terms") and terms and conditions, if any, specific to use of individual Services (hereinafter the "Service Specific Terms"). The General Terms and Service Specific Terms are collectively referred to as the "Terms". In the event of a conflict between the General Terms and Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms shall prevail.</p><br />

                        <h4>Acceptance of the Terms</h4>
                        <p>You must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to accept the Terms. If you do not agree to the General Terms, do not use any of our Services. If you agree to the General Terms and do not agree to any Service Specific Terms, do not use the corresponding Service. You can accept the Terms by checking a checkbox or clicking on a button indicating your acceptance of the
                            terms or by actually using the Services. By Signing up with Statusnap, by default you accept the terms and conditions of service.</p><br />

                        <h4>Description of Service</h4>
                        <p>You may use Statusnap for your personal and business use or for internal business purpose in the organization that you represent. You may connect to Statusnap using any Internet browser supported by the Services. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use Statusnap. You can create and edit content with your user account and if you choose to do so, you can publish and share such content.</p><br />

                        <h4>Subscription to Beta Service</h4>
                        <p>We may offer certain Services as closed or open beta services (&quot;Beta Service&quot; or "Beta Services") for the purpose of testing and evaluation. You agree that we have the sole authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of Beta Services. We will be the sole judge of the success of such testing and the decision, if any, to offer the Beta Services as commercial services. You will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to use any paid Service as a result of your subscription to any Beta Service. We reserve the right to fully or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the Beta Services with or without notice to you. You agree that Beyond Bytes will not be liable to you or to any third party for any harm related to, arising out of, or caused by the modification, suspension or discontinuance of any of the Beta Services for any reason.</p><br />

                        <h4>Modification of Terms of Service</h4>
                        <p>We may modify the Terms upon notice to you at any time through a service announcement or by sending email to your primary email address. If we make significant changes to the Terms that affect your rights, you will be provided with at least 30 days advance notice of the changes by email to your primary email address. You may terminate your use of the Services by providing Beyond Bytes notice by email within 30 days of being notified of the availability of the modified Terms if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of the Services. In the event of such termination, you will be entitled to prorated refund of the unused portion of any prepaid fees. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be your agreement to the modified Terms.</p><br />

                        <h4>User Sign up Obligations</h4>
                        <p>You need to sign up for a user account by providing all required information in order to access Statusnap. If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your organization, sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate contact information. In particular, we recommend that you use your corporate email address. You agree to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly update the information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

                        <p>When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify one or more administrators. The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account. If your organization account is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for your organization. Make sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as an administrator of your organization account. You are responsible for i) ensuring confidentiality of your organization account password, ii) appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing your organization account, and iii) ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with your organization account comply with this Agreement. You understand that Beyond Bytes is not responsible for account administration and internal management of the Services for you. You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that your organization does not lose control of the administrator accounts. You may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email <a href="mailto:statusnap@beyondbytes.co.in">statusnap@beyondbytes.co.in</a> , provided that the process is acceptable to Beyond Bytes. In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, Beyond Bytes may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to Beyond Bytes demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold Beyond Bytes liable for the consequences of any action taken by Beyond Bytes in good faith in this regard.</p><br />

                        <h4>Personal Information and Privacy</h4>
                        <p>Your election to use the Service indicates your acceptance of the terms of the Beyond Bytes Privacy Policy. You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your username, password and other sensitive information. You are responsible for all activities that occur in your user account and you agree to inform us immediately of any unauthorized use of your user account by email to <a href="mailto:statusnap@beyondbytes.co.in">statusnap@beyondbytes.co.in</a> or by calling us on any of the numbers listed on <a htef="https://www.statusnap.com">Statusnap</a> .

                        <h4>Fees and Payments</h4>
                        <p>The Services are available under subscription plans of various durations. Payments for subscription plans of duration of less than a year can be made only by Credit Card. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you downgrade your paid subscription plan to a free plan or inform us that you do not wish to renew the subscription.

We provide you the option of changing the details if you would like the payment for the renewal to be made through a different Credit Card or payment option. If you do not wish to renew the subscription, you must inform us at least seven days prior to the renewal date.
